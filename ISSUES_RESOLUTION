1. MODULE SCOPE


    i was adding create() function to

    <button onclick="create()"> </button>

    however, the js file CreateTemplate is a module and is only module scoped

    which means it thinks that create() is a "global" function when it was only module scoped

    so it's trying to access a functions it thinks is global but is only scoped from the module



2. THE CONFIG FOR THE DB USED NOT UPDATING
    OR GETTING ERROCONNECTION OR REFUSED CONNECTION ERROR


    it was not connecting to the configs for thr
    cleardb but for the local host


    take this for example


    #HOST = localhost
    #USER = ernesto
    #PASSWORD = 1234567
    #DATABASE = myportfoly

    HOST = us-cdbr-east-06.cleardb.net
    USER = b4c690a417b791
    PASSWORD = d2101a6a
    DATABASE = heroku_22d027a4e69faed


    it would not be updated to know to use
    the config from CLEARDB

    so to get it to work I had to do

    console.log(process.env.DATABASE)

    as a way to 'refresh it'

    it's weird but for some reason that's what was happening




    OKAY, I KNOW WHY, I THINK

    EVERY CHANGE MADE TO THE .ENV REQUIRES THE SERVER TO BE RESTARTED
    ( even with NodeMon? )


3. CLEARDB CONNECTION CLOSING AFTER AROUND 1 MINUTE

    REPLACE

    var connection = mysql.createConnection({
        // my configuration
    })

    with

    var conn = mysql.createPool({
        // my configuration
    })

    And removed the code var conn = connection.connect().
    It worked like a charm!
